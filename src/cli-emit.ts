/**
 * The `compile <input> --out-dir <dir>` command the gea build pipeline drives.
 *
 * `core/packages/core/scripts/build-gea-vite-geatsc.mjs` already resolves the
 * compiler it runs through `--geatsc-bin` (line 3973), so this is an adapter on
 * THIS side of that seam and needs no change to the shipping pipeline: the
 * simulator, the esp32 targets and the apple targets all reach a compiler the
 * same way, and pointing that one option at this binary is the whole
 * integration. What the pipeline then expects back is narrow and stated in one
 * place -- the `.cpp` translation unit(s) in `--out-dir`, and a
 * `geatsc-sources.txt` beside them listing each one (and `geatsc-header.txt`
 * naming the shared header when the layout has one), which the calling script
 * reads to build its compile line.
 *
 * ## Options this honors, and the ones it refuses to pretend about
 *
 * The pipeline passes v1's whole option set, and most of it describes v1's own
 * build plumbing rather than a question this compiler answers. Ignoring an
 * option silently is the failure this file is written to avoid: `--cpp-board`
 * and `--allow-any` both CHANGE THE PROGRAM in v1, so a build that quietly
 * dropped them would produce a unit that does not match what the caller asked
 * for and no output would say so. Every option that is not honored is named on
 * stderr, once, by the name the caller passed.

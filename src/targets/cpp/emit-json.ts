/**
 * `JSON.stringify`/`JSON.parse(...) as T`, rendered by generating one
 * `gea_json_write`/`gea_json_read` free-function overload per record shape a
 * call site actually reaches, instead of routing every call through one boxed
 * `gea_cpp_value`-shaped signature the way `Math`/`Console`/`Storage`'s fixed
 * `HostMember` templates (`host-members.ts`) do.
 *
 * `JSON` cannot be spelled that way at all: its declared signatures are
 * `stringify(value: any, ...) => string` / `parse(text: string, ...) => any`,
 * and a fixed C++ ABI for either is only reachable by boxing -- exactly the
 * `gea_cpp_value` shortcut this compiler forbids. Every call site's REAL
 * argument/asserted-result type is known statically (the checker's own type
 * at that expression), so this file generates a serializer/deserializer typed
 * to that exact call, the same way `emit-json.ts`'s prior art in v1
 * (`compiler/packages/geatsc/src/targets/cpp/runtime/json.h`/`json_reader.h`)
 * already does for its own non-boxing `__gea_json_into`/`__gea_json_read`
 * fast path -- ported here as free functions dispatched by argument-dependent
 * lookup instead of v1's member functions, so this compiler's own
 * `records.ts` struct declarations need no change at all (see citations.md
 * finding 1 and the port's patch.md).
 *
 * Typed records, nullable values, dictionaries and arrays retain their native
 * carriers. See `jsonUnsupportedReason` for the exhaustive supported shapes.
 * Unasserted JSON and explicitly dynamic fields use the dynamic JSON boundary;
 * static fields never need a boxed
 * carrier. A self-referential record TYPE is supported -- it renders a
 * recursive overload pair, forward-declared -- because a recursive type is
 * not a cyclic value; see `jsonUnsupportedReason`'s own note. `undefined` inside a record
 * property is *omitted* on write (ECMA-262 `SerializeJSONProperty`) and left
 * at its default value on read when the document never mentions the key;
 * inside an array position `undefined` -- like a hole -- writes and reads as
 * `null`, which `gea_runtime.h`'s array template owns, not this file.
 *
 * Not implemented, disclosed rather than silently wrong (this port's
 * risks.md): a `.toJSON()` override, `replacer`/`space`/`reviver`, and cycle
 * detection -- a self-referential *value* recurses until the stack overflows,
 * where node raises a `TypeError`.

 * `JSON.stringify(v)` written straight into the cell that receives it, as
 * whole statements, instead of into a temporary the following write copies out
 * of. `null` whenever any condition that would make the two observably
 * different fails, in which case the ordinary expression form renders.
 *
 * The conditions are each a way the cell and the temporary are not the same
 * storage:
 *  - the cell must HOLD a plain `std::string`. A union, an optional, a
 *    `Signal`, a shared box, an integer-narrowed cell: none of those is a
 *    buffer `gea_json_write` can append into, and a reactive cell additionally
 *    owes a notify the direct write would skip.
 *  - the cell must be this frame's own local or a file-scope cell it may name.
 *  - the write must not be one that renders nothing on its own
 *    (`formalCells`), which would leave the fill duplicating a value the
 *    formal already holds under another name.
 *  - the argument must not READ the cell, DIRECTLY OR THROUGH ANYTHING IT IS
 *    DERIVED FROM. `s = JSON.stringify(s)` reads the very buffer the `clear()`
 *    empties and would serialize `""`; so does `s = JSON.stringify({ s })`,
 *    whose argument is a record one of whose fields was loaded from that same
 *    buffer. Asked of the IR -- `ctx.valueCellReads`, the transitive closure of
 *    what each value's operands read -- rather than of the argument's rendered
 *    C++ text.
 *
 *    Both halves of that matter, and they fail in opposite directions. A text
 *    scan misses a read of the same declaration reached through a
 *    differently-spelled reference (a reactive accessor, an environment
 *    indirection), because the cell's own name is not in the rendered text.
 *    Asking `bindingReadDeclarations` -- whether the argument IS that read --
 *    fixes that but narrows the question to one value, and a derived argument
 *    walks straight past it. The closure is the only form of the question that
 *    holds in both directions.
 *
 * One difference is real and deliberate: if the serializer throws part-way --
 * which it can only do by failing to allocate -- the cell holds a partial
 * document where the temporary form would have left the previous value. The
 * hand-written baselines this is measured against (`text.clear(); ser(text,
 * tree);`) have the same property, and a program that catches `bad_alloc` and
 * then reads the half-written buffer is not a shape this compiler serves.

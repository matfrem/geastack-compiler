 * body returns (`void`, for nine of the ten in three.js's renderer), while
 * `[[Construct]]` manufactures the receiver and evaluates to it. The two

 * `borrowed` is refused there for the reason it is refused here -- an
 * allocation has no object to point at.
 *
 * The receiver the body declares and the object this returns must be the SAME
 * carrier, and where they are not, what is rendered is a fault rather than a

 * was INSTALLED on (`structural-receiver.ts`'s `jsConstructorReceiverOf`) while
 * TypeScript's constructor-function inference still gives it a construct
 * signature returning the subset of fields it happens to assign. Nothing can

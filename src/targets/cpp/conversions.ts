/**
 * What this backend can actually convert, stated as a registry the conversion
 * graph asks rather than assumes.
 *
 * Most entries are `null`, and that is the honest answer rather than a
 * placeholder. Conversion *from* the dynamic carrier -- classifying a boxed
 * value and materializing a concrete one out of it -- needs the box to be able
 * to say what it holds and to hand the payload back, and an entry is installed
 * here only where a primitive that really does both is already built.
 *
 * This paragraph used to say `gea::Value` could do neither, and that it was
 * storage and a tag and deliberately nothing more. The second half is right
 * about the part that matters -- a box has no dynamic OPERATIONS, no call, no
 * arithmetic, no coercion, which is what keeps a program that reads an
 * `unknown` refused while one that merely carries an unread one compiles. The
 * first half was wrong, and wrong in a way that hid four working primitives
 * behind a blanket claim: `Value::box` records
 * `payloadTypeTagFor<std::decay_t<T>>()` for every payload it stores, so a box
 * can name its payload's exact C++ type, and `gea::detail::unboxAs` hands that
 * payload back after checking both the tag and that type. Reporting a payload
 * is not the same capability as operating on one, and only the second is
 * deliberately absent.
 *
 * So the discipline this file keeps is not "install almost nothing". It is:
 * install exactly where a real classifier and a real materializer exist and
 * their domains are disjoint, and refuse everywhere else WITH THE REASON, so
 * that a later reader can tell an unimplemented entry from an impossible one.
 * A blanket claim cannot make that distinction, which is how the class-ref
 * entry below came to be missing for as long as it was while both directions
 * of its round trip sat built and unused.
 *
 * The one entry that is installed is the narrowing unwrap, and it is installed
 * because it is genuinely built. `gea::Optional<T>` (gea_runtime.h) is a
 * presence flag plus an always-constructed payload, with `has_value()` as the
 * pure membership test and `operator*` as the load. Both are real operations on
 * a real type, and `emitBindingRead` renders exactly them.
 *
 * What licenses the unwrap is the checker's own narrowing, not a proof this
 * backend re-derives: inside `if (tag)` TypeScript has already established that
 * the cell holds a value, and re-testing it here would be a second authority
 * answering a settled question -- and would need somewhere to go when it
 * disagreed, which a load has not got. The payload is always constructed, so a
 * narrowing that was somehow wrong reads a default-constructed value rather
 * than stepping off the end of anything; deterministic, and still wrong, which
 * is the right place for the consequence of an unsound narrowing to land.
 */
/**
 * The exact-tag read out of a box, for the three carriers whose payload C++
 * type the carrier itself names.
 *
 * `gea::detail::unboxValue` (gea_runtime.h) checks the box's tag AND the C++
 * type of its payload and aborts by name when either disagrees, so this is an
 * exact tag test and never a coercion -- which is the discipline
 * `ConversionRuntimeRegistry` puts on these three entries specifically. What
 * licenses it is the same thing that licenses the narrowing unwrap below: the
 * program stated the type (`a as unknown as string`) and the checker erased
 * the statement, so the only thing left to do at runtime is read the payload
 * and refuse loudly if it is not there.
 *
 * `emit-narrowing.ts`'s `unboxedLoadText` renders this same
 * `unboxValue<T>` load, and it renders it for every tag that has a payload to
 * read rather than only for these three -- which is why `classRefMaterializer`
 * below can be installed without touching the emitter at all.

     * happened to name. What actually discriminates is `payloadType()`:
     * `Value::box` records `payloadTypeTagFor<std::decay_t<T>>()` for EVERY
     * payload it stores -- one program-wide address per C++ type, `typeid`
     * without RTTI -- and `gea::detail::unboxAs` compares the tag AND that
     * address, refusing by name when either disagrees. That is a real classifier
     * over a really-stored fact, which is why the domain below is keyed on the
     * class identity and not on the tag.
     *
     * Both halves of the round trip were already built and only this entry was
     * missing: `dynamicTagFor` boxes `class-ref`, and `unboxedLoadText` renders
     * `unboxValue<T>` for every tag except the three with no payload to read.
     * `dynamicTagFor`'s own comment writes this same argument out for
     * `typed-array`, which reached the identical conclusion by the identical
     * route.
     *
     * Only `shared-refcount` is installed. The other two are refused with a
     * reason rather than left for later, because for each of them the refusal is
     * the correct permanent answer as the runtime currently stands:
     *
     * - `borrowed` spells `Foo&` (`cppOwnershipWrap`), and `box` decays the
     *   reference away before recording the type, so `payloadTypeTagFor<Foo&>`
     *   cannot equal what any box holds. Installing it would emit a load that
     *   aborts on every execution rather than one that sometimes works.
     *   `narrowing` above refuses borrowed targets for a separate lifetime
     *   reason, and both reasons apply here.
     * - `owned` spells a bare `Foo`, which `unboxValue` reaches by
     *   copy-constructing from the `const Foo&` `unboxAs` hands back, while
     *   boxing the same value needs only a MOVE (`makeRef<std::decay_t<T>>`
     *   forwards). So the question is whether any emitted struct is
     *   copy-constructible, and that is decidable rather than speculative:
     *   `records.ts` writes no copy constructor and no assignment operator at
     *   all, so copyability is never a property of the class this compiler
     *   emits -- it is implicitly derived from the FIELD carriers. Surveying
     *   every emitted struct across the corpus gives a closed carrier
     *   vocabulary, and `is_copy_constructible_v` holds for all of the ones this
     *   header owns (`double`, `bool`, `long long`, `std::string`,
     *   `gea::Optional<T>`, `gea::TaggedUnion<...>`, `gea::Ref<T>`,
     *   `gea::Value`) and for a struct built from them.
     *
     *   What is still unproven is the HOST-owned carriers a struct can also hold
     *   -- `gea::apple::UIKit::*`, `embedded::ui::Signal<T>`, `NodeHandle`,
     *   `CanvasRenderingContext2D` -- which live in headers this survey did not
     *   reach. One move-only type among them is all it takes, and it would fail
     *   as a clang error inside a generated struct rather than at the entry that
     *   licensed it. So this stays refused until that half is checked too: a
     *   narrower reason than the one first written here, and the honest one.

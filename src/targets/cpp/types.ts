 * source property literally named `_0` would otherwise collide, and two
 * distinct fields sharing one member is a silently wrong layout.
 *
 * A symbol-keyed field is the identical situation with a different shape of
 * key: `derive.ts` publishes it as `sym(<declaration>)` rather than digits,
 * and this is the one place that becomes `gea_sym_<mangled declaration>` --
 * an ordinary struct member, not a runtime lookup, because a symbol key is a
 * compile-time constant identity. Naming it by declaration id rather than by
 * the symbol's own printable description is what keeps `{[Symbol.iterator]:
 * f}` and `{"Symbol(Symbol.iterator)": f}` -- two different objects -- from
 * ever mangling to the same member: the declaration id is stable identity,
 * the description is not even unique (`Symbol('x')` and a second, unrelated

 * key, and any key already wearing the `gea_` prefix. Each of those used to
 * throw. Throwing broke the contract `cppRecordDeclarations` states in

 * escaping from there takes down a compilation that has a perfectly good
 * report to give" -- and it was not even a gap to report: `{'counter-value':

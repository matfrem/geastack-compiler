  // `Optional<Ref<TypedArray<uint8_t>>>` for a `ReadableStream<Uint8Array>`

 * handing back a zero.
 *
 * The `...items` form is refused: each item owes a conversion to the array's
 * element carrier, which is lowering's to state (it is what an array literal

 * a single non-numeric argument -- `new Array("a")` is a one-element array,

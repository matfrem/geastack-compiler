 * twin pair for the one receiver kind whose `[[Get]]` needs a class layout to
 * answer at all.
 *
 * Split out of `emit-properties.ts` (2026-09-03) to keep that file under the
 * architecture gate's per-file line cap -- a directory split, not a design
 * change: `emitGet` still dispatches here for a `class-ref`/`constructor-
 * family` receiver exactly as it dispatched to these same two functions when
 * they lived inline.
 */

/**
 * The `environment` half of the `CallableObject{invoke, environment}` a method
 * READ produces.
 *
 * `emitAllocateCallable` builds this for a closure literal; a method reached
 * through `[[Get]]` needs the identical thing and used to hard-code `nullptr`
 * for it. That is only correct when the method's body captures nothing. When
 * it does capture -- a class declared inside a function, whose method reads
 * that function's local -- the thunk casts the `void*` it is handed to the
 * body's environment struct and dereferences it unconditionally
 * (`translation-unit.ts` writes that cast), so a `nullptr` there is a null
 * dereference at the first captured read. It was reached, certified clean and
 * segfaulted: `.scratch/probe/capture` compiles, clang accepts it, and
 * `make(41)` dies on `gea_e->c0`. The environment is not optional information
 * this can default; it is the frame the body will read.
 *
 * The fields are read with `bindingReference` in the frame performing the
 * READ, which is the same rule `emitAllocateCallable` uses in the frame
 * performing the allocation -- and it is what makes this fail closed rather
 * than guess: a read from a frame that cannot name the captured cell raises
 * `bindingReference`'s own "a cell owned by another callable frame" refusal
 * instead of producing a pointer to nothing.
 *
 * Two shapes are refused outright rather than rendered, because this returns
 * an EXPRESSION and neither can be expressed without emitting a statement
 * first:
 *
 * - a BOXED slot, whose box `emitAllocateCallable` declares with
 *   `ensureBoxedSlotDeclared` ahead of the environment build;
 * - a captured RECEIVER, whose field is this frame's own `gea_this` -- which
 *   exists only if the reading frame has a receiver at all, a fact this
 *   expression-level path has no way to establish.

/**
 * The representation a materialized instance-method VALUE actually needs --

 * TS call signature, correctly: a method's declared TYPE never states an
 * implicit receiver parameter, so the `CallableAbi` it builds always has
 * `receiver: null`. But the C++ thunk this value actually points at
 * (`cppThunkName(site.method.callable)`, built by `translation-unit.ts`'s
 * `thunkOf`/`formalsOf`) gives every receiver-bearing body an EXPLICIT
 * leading receiver formal whenever `abi.receiver !== null` -- `cppAbiType`
 * (`types.ts`) documents the identical rule for spelling the type: "the
 * receiver (if any) as the first formal". A materialized value that keeps
 * the TS-derived, receiver-less type disagrees with the thunk it is built
 * from: the declared arity is missing the one argument the thunk requires,
 * and the one argument every caller that reaches it through `.call(receiver)`
 * -- `emit-iterator.ts`'s `emitDynamicGetIterator` is the caller that surfaced
 * this, calling exactly `${method}.call(${receiverText})` on the documented
 * assumption that `classMemberText` built the callable to expect it -- already
 * supplies.
 *
 * This has no effect on the common `obj.method()` case: that never
 * materializes this operation's value as a standalone `CallableObject` at
 * all (`emit-callable.ts`'s direct-call path calls the body by name once it
 * sees `ctx.directCallees`, without ever reading this text). It matters only
 * when a method is read as a first-class value and called separately from
 * where it was read -- rare in application code, but exactly the shape the
 * general iterator protocol mints (`get-method` and `get-iterator` are two
 * separate operations; `producers/protocol.ts`'s `mintIteratorSteps`) and,
 * per the `constructor-family`/`function-value-dispatch` split `cppTypeOf`
 * already documents, exactly as sound for a plain callback reference.
 *
 * A static member (`classConstructorStaticMemberText`, this file's twin) has
 * no receiver and needs no correction -- this helper is only ever called from

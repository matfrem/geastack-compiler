 * What moves here is the mechanical part: given that the receiver is already
 * known to be an Array, a typed array, a string or a scalar, what text does
 * the member read render to. Each answers `null` for a receiver that is not
 * its own, so the caller's dispatch stays a single ordered sequence.

 * key that spells a canonical index (`a[0]`, `a["0"]`) is an element access
 * exactly like a computed one, just with the index known at compile time.
 * A constant key naming one of `arrayPrototypeMethods` (see
 * `emit-prototype-array.ts`, the one authority for which those are) defers
 * instead of refusing: the access records which method was reached and renders
 * nothing, and the following call fuses it with the receiver. Every other
 * constant key is still an ordinary property this carrier has no table for,
 * and stays refused by name -- with a stated reason where `arrayMemberRefusals`
 * has one, because "not built yet" and "cannot be built without X" are
 * different answers and only the second tells you what to build.
 *
 * `result` is the `[[Get]]`'s own SSA value id, needed only for the deferred

/**
 * An indexed Array read whose result carrier can be ABSENT, or `null` when it

 * carrier is `T` and there is no `undefined` in it to produce.
 * `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` is one case where the checker says otherwise: the
 * result is `T | undefined`, the carrier is absence-capable, and the
 * language's own answer for a hole or an out-of-range index is that
 * `undefined` rather than a fault. A genuinely dynamic element/result pair is
 * the other: `gea::Value` itself carries `undefined`, so returning the bare
 * reader would abort where its stated result can represent the exact answer.
 * Emitting the bare reader for either leaves two authorities on one read --
 * the carrier promising absence the access never produces.
 *
 * The presence test is `ArrayObject::hasElement`, which is `elementAt`'s own
 * abort condition negated and stated once in the runtime, so "readable" cannot
 * drift between the two. Both arms are written in the optional's own spelling
 * rather than relying on the conditional operator to find a common type
 * through `Optional<T>`'s converting constructor -- the same shape
 * `narrowedLoadText` already writes for a narrowed optional load.
 *
 * The receiver and the key are re-mentioned, not re-evaluated: both are
 * operand texts, which are SSA names or literals.
 *
 * `null` for every other mismatch, which keeps this to the case it can answer:
 * a result carrier that differs from the element for some other reason is left
 * exactly as it rendered before.

 * The String reading of a property access, or `null` when the receiver is not

 *
 * `length` is the only own data property a JavaScript string has; everything
 * else `String.prototype` exposes is a method, and a method reference is a
 * `[[Get]]` too -- `s.slice(...)`'s callee is its own `property` operation,
 * cited by the call the same way a class method's is. Rendering one as a
 * value needs a receiver-carrying calling convention, and the checker's
 * structural signature for an ambient interface method (as opposed to a class
 * method body) carries no `this` parameter -- `structural.ts`'s
 * `implicitReceiverOf` synthesizes one only for a class's own method, not for
 * a `lib.es5.d.ts` interface member. Rendering the method anyway would emit a
 * call that drops the receiver, exactly the mismatch `emit.ts`'s call
 * emission already refuses by its own fail-closed guard.
 *
 * A key naming one of `stringPrototypeMethods` (see `emit-prototype-string.ts`,
 * the one authority for which those are) is the one exception: instead of rendering the method here, the access
 * defers -- it records which member was reached off which receiver and
 * renders nothing, and the following call fuses receiver, method and
 * arguments into one expression, sidestepping the missing-receiver problem
 * entirely rather than solving it generically. Every other key is still
 * refused by name instead of guessed at: the gap is the missing receiver
 * upstream, not a rendering this file could supply for an unimplemented
 * method.
 *
 * The one key that is neither `length` nor a method is a canonical INDEX --
 * `s[i]`, ECMA-262 10.4.3's String exotic `[[Get]]`, which answers a
 * single-code-unit string. See `stringIndexText`.

 * that projection (`substringUtf16` over `utf16Length`) -- is where the index
 * space is decided, rather than restated here where the two could disagree.
 *
 * ## Out of range, and the carrier
 *
 * The spec's answer for an out-of-range or non-integer index is `undefined`,
 * and `charAt`'s is the empty string. That divergence is not observable
 * through the type the checker gives this read: `lib.es5.d.ts` declares
 * `String`'s index signature `readonly [index: number]: string`, so the result
 * carrier is `string`, there is no `undefined` in it to produce, and a program
 * that compares the result against `undefined` is refused by the checker
 * before this emitter is reached ("types 'string' and 'undefined' have no
 * overlap"). `arrayAccessText`'s `elementAt` answers an out-of-range Array
 * index the same way and for the same reason -- the checker types `a[i]` as
 * `T`, not `T | undefined` -- so this is the backend's existing convention,
 * not a new one taken here.
 *
 * A program compiled with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` is the case where the
 * difference IS in the type: the checker then says `string | undefined`, the
 * carrier is absence-capable, and a bare `std::string` would be the wrong
 * one. That is refused by name rather than rendered, because producing the
 * absence needs a materialization this function is not the place to decide.
 *
 * The integer guard on the computed path is this access's own rule and not
 * `charAt`'s: `charAt(1.5)` truncates to 1 and answers a real code unit,
 * while `s[1.5]` reads the ordinary property `"1.5"`, which a string does not
 * have. Under a `string` carrier the honest answer for it is the same empty
 * string every other out-of-range index gets. A constant index has already
 * been proved canonical by `canonicalIndexLiteral`, so it needs no guard at
 * all.

 * instead of its fields. `null` covers three different receivers with one
 * answer -- neither carrier, a `record-with-index` (impossible: every one has
 * an index by construction), and a `native-record-ref` whose named shape has
 * none -- the last of which is exactly what `preflight/property-access.ts`'s
 * `nativeRecordRefHasIndexSidecar` already refuses to certify, so an

 *
 * The store counterpart of `recordIndexSidecarReadText` directly above, and
 * built the identical way: `recordIndexSidecarTableOf` already declines a
 * CONSTANT key that names one of the receiver's own declared fields (the
 * struct half of the split layout, written by the generic field store at the
 * end of `emitFieldStoreLines` instead), so asking it is enough to tell the
 * two halves apart -- this function does not re-decide that split, only
 * dispatch on its answer. A COMPUTED key can never name a declared field in
 * the first place (`recordIndexSidecarReadText`'s own comment states why:
 * the checker itself routes a computed access of a mixed-shape type through
 * the index signature, never through a named field, because a runtime key's
 * identity is not known at compile time), so `recordIndexSidecarTableOf`
 * answers it unconditionally, the same way `record-with-index:get:true`
 * already claims the read.
 *
 * `{ count: 1, 0: 'zero' }` against
 * `interface Mixed { count: number; [index: number]: string }` is ordinary
 * TypeScript: `count` is the struct half of the split layout and `0` is the
 * open half. Only an index signature admits the second key at all -- without
 * one TypeScript rejects it as an excess property -- so this is reached
 * exactly when the sidecar is the key's only possible home.
 *
 * The read side has resolved both halves since it was written; the store
 * side originally had a counterpart for the constant half only, so a
 * constant key that named no field fell through every branch of
 * `emitFieldStoreLines` to the generic struct-member write at its end and
 * spelled `receiver->gea_slot_0`, a member `records.ts` never laid out
 * because it laid out the sidecar instead -- and a COMPUTED key that named no
 * field fell all the way to `emitNativeSidecarSet`, which reaches this same
 * receiver but through the wrong table: its own `gea::nativeDynamicSet` is
 * the BOXED dynamic-property expando a native type's `(this as any)[k] = v`
 * cast reaches, keyed and valued in `gea::Value`, not the typed table this
 * carrier's own index signature already states a value carrier for -- so an
 * array-typed (or otherwise unboxed) sidecar value had no box tag to go
 * through and refused outright, though the identical value already reads
 * back correctly through `recordIndexSidecarReadText` on the very same
 * carrier. Widening this function to the computed case, ahead of
 * `emitNativeSidecarSet` in `emitFieldStoreLines`'s own dispatch order
 * (unchanged), is what makes the store side total the way the read side
 * already is; `emitNativeSidecarSet` keeps its computed-key claim for every
 * receiver that has no such typed sidecar to route into at all.

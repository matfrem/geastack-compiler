 *
 * The no-write-during-render rule, which moved these facts out of the target:
 * rendering is a READ of settled facts, and a printer that writes one during
 * render is a second authority over it. Before this type existed, these
 * twelve fields were typed exactly like `EmitContext`'s real OUTPUT buffers
 * (`valueNames`, `declarations`, `ownedValues`, minted during the render walk
 * itself) -- `Map`/`Set`, mutable, with nothing in the type distinguishing
 * "settled once, up front" from "grows as printing proceeds". Three of the
 * twelve (`computeOrigins`, `propertyReadOrigins`, `bindingReadDeclarations`)
 * were not even settled up front in practice: `targets/cpp/emit.ts`'s
 * `emitCompute`, `targets/cpp/emit-properties.ts`'s `emitGet` and
 * `targets/cpp/emit-bindings.ts`'s `emitBindingRead` filled them as a side
 * effect of rendering the very operation each answer is keyed by, and
 * `registerDirectCalleeOfDeadValue` kept an independent second copy of the
 * `bindingReadDeclarations` write for a value `deadValuesOf` skips rendering
 * -- one fact, two writers, agreeing only because nobody had asked them to.
 *
 * Every field here is computed by `emitBody` from `body` (and, for
 * `constructorOf`, the `classes` layout it already receives as a plain
 * parameter) BEFORE `createEmitContext` is called at all, so none of it can
 * observe -- or be observed to depend on -- anything a printer has emitted.
 * The remaining ~25 fields this refactor's inventory also classifies as
 * settled-before-render facts (the `ir/facts.ts` `IrBodyCensus` output,
 * `formalCells`/`capacityHints`/`fillLoops`/`directBindingSinks`/the dense-loop
 * admission) are not bundled here: they are already filled by `emitBody`
 * strictly before its render loop runs (verified by inventory -- zero write
 * sites outside that prologue), but moving THEM into this same
 * caller-computes-first shape would also require narrowing the several
 * `ctx: EmitContext`-typed helper functions their policy hooks call
 * (`isPlainMemberRead`, `directClassMethodBody`, `denseCellName`, ...) to a
 * type that does not presuppose a fully-built context -- real, but separable,

 * Mutable handles onto the thirty-three settled fields
 * `EmitContext` exposes as `ReadonlyMap`/`ReadonlySet` -- the SAME Map/Set
 * instances `ctx` itself carries, under an ordinarily-mutable type.
 *
 * `EmitBodyFacts`'s own doc explains why these thirty-three could not join it:
 * `emitBody`'s census (`irBodyCensusOf`) needs a real, already-built `ctx` to
 * run at all, because several of its hooks call claims that read OTHER
 * settled fields off `ctx` (`isPlainMemberRead`, `directClassMethodBody`,
 * `spellConstants`). So `ctx` has to exist before these thirty-three can be
 * filled, which rules out computing them up front the way `EmitBodyFacts`
 * does -- but every one of them is still settled strictly before
 * `sealFactFieldsForRender` is called (verified by inventory: their only
 * write sites are `emit.ts`'s own prepass, never a printer), so the render
 * half of invariant 5 holds regardless. `createEmitContext` returns this
 * alongside `ctx` so `emitBody`'s prepass keeps the one authorized way to
 * fill them, while every other reader -- meaning every renderer, in every
 * other file -- sees only `ctx`'s `ReadonlyMap`/`ReadonlySet` view and cannot
 * compile a `.set`/`.add`/`.delete` on any of them.
 *
 * Nine of them are filled by a collector that does not live in `emit.ts` at
 * all -- `collectFormalCells`, `collectDirectBindingSinks` (`emit-bindings.
 * ts`), `collectCapacityHints`, `admitDenseWindows` (`emit-arrays.ts`). Those
 * take this handle as a parameter rather than reaching through `ctx`, which
 * is what lets the field stay read-only for everyone else: the collector's
 * own signature now states that it writes, and a renderer in the same file
 * still cannot, because it was never handed one. `scripts/architecture.mjs`
 * used to guard these nine by matching the enclosing FUNCTION NAME of every
 * `ctx.<field>.set(...)`; that rule is deleted for them, because a type the
 * compiler checks in every program beats a name a script matches in the
 * files it happens to scan.
 *
 * `deferrable` was the last holdout, on the belief that
 * `materializeDenseReference` deleted from it mid-render. It does not: its one
 * caller is `admitDenseWindows`, which runs in the prepass like the rest. The
 * belief had been written down twice and never checked against the call graph,

 * C++ has no such rule: `construct()` against a

 * arguments", full stop. `new Quaternion()` against `constructor(w = 1, x = 0,

 * happens to allow -- an `optional` tagged `null` would answer a later
 * `=== null` with `true`, which is a wrong answer and not a spelling gap. A
 * rest slot is refused here too: what a caller owes a rest parameter is an
 * allocated array, and building one is lowering's, not this line's.
 *
 * Shared between the generic callable-carrier invoke path (`emit-callable.ts`)

 * parameter (`new MediaRecorder(stream)` against `new (stream, options?)`)
 * needs the identical padding a generic constructor carrier already gets --

 * explicitly would emit, and the ones that rely on the parameter's own

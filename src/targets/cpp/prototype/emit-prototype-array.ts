/**
 * `Array.prototype`, as this backend renders it.
 *
 * Clause numbers throughout are ECMA-262 2023 (14th edition), where
 * `Array.prototype`'s members are numbered alphabetically -- stated because the
 * numbering shifts every edition that adds a member, so a clause is only
 * unambiguous once its edition is named. The member NAME is the identity; the
 * clause is the pointer.
 *
 * The mechanism is `emit-prototype-invoke.ts`'s -- a deferred `[[Get]]` fused
 * with the call that follows -- and its header states why. What lives here is
 * the table: which members are claimed, at which arities, over which argument
 * carriers, and which are refused BY NAME with what missing.
 *
 * The runtime behind it is `gea::runtime::array` over this backend's own
 * `ArrayObject<E>`. That namespace's header states why these are written
 * rather than ported: v1's typed (`std::vector<T>`) array surface stops at
 * length, indexed get/set and iteration, and every method past that takes a
 * BOXED `gea_cpp_value` receiver -- which a statically typed array may not be
 * lowered into. v1's generic implementation is the spec reference the step
 * order follows; the carrier stays typed.
 *
 * Two rules recur below and are stated once here:
 *
 *  - An argument that must BE an element (`indexOf`'s needle, `fill`'s value)
 *    is checked against the receiver's own element carrier by
 *    `representationKey`. The checker's `T` binds identically for both, so a
 *    disagreement should never happen -- but if it did it would alias two
 *    differently laid-out `ArrayObject<T>` instantiations, a real miscompile
 *    C++ would not catch, so it is refused rather than assumed (`push`'s own
 *    long-standing check, generalized).
 *  - A CALLBACK argument is converted, not checked: `gea::runtime::array`'s
 *    templates invoke whatever they are handed with the element type, at the
 *    arity the callable actually takes, and where the callback's first
 *    parameter is declared WIDER than the element the element is injected into
 *    it at the boundary (`elementAdaptedCallbackText`), by the same conversion
 *    authority every direct call site uses. Anything past that is left to C++,
 *    which rejects a callable that cannot take what it is handed at the same
 *    call this renders.

 * three-argument arity and then fail to call a one-parameter callback inside
 * its own body. The callable is init-captured by value so an rvalue callback
 * expression is evaluated once, not once per element.
 *
 * Untouched when the first parameter already carries the element -- the text
 * is exactly what it was, so nothing that emitted before moves -- and untouched
 * for a callable that is not a `function-value-dispatch` or that declares a
 * receiver, which the runtime passes `Undefined{}` for ahead of the element.

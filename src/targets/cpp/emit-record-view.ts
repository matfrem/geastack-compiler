/**
 * The structural-record-view plan, built once per `(layouts, source,
 * target)` and shared between the two places that ask for it:
 * `conversions.ts`'s `staticRecipe`, which tests whether a view exists at
 * all while the conversion census derives the pair's capability, and
 * `structuralRecordViewText` below, which spells the plan the census
 * already built. Without this cache the two independently ran
 * `structuralRecordViewPlan` -- decided the pair twice, the same defect this
 * refactor removes for the chain's own steps (`conversionRecipeOf`'s memo).
 *
 * Lives here rather than in `conversions.ts`: this module already sits
 * downstream of `emit-narrowing.ts` (for `chainConverts`) and
 * `conversions.ts` already sits upstream of `emit-narrowing.ts`, so a
 * `conversions.ts` import of this file adds one edge to an existing acyclic
 * chain, while the reverse (this file importing from `conversions.ts`)
 * would close `emit-narrowing.ts -> emit-record-view.ts -> conversions.ts
 * -> emit-narrowing.ts` into a cycle through a THIRD file, worse than the
 * two-file cycle `emit-narrowing.ts`/`emit-record-view.ts` already have.
 *
 * Keyed by object identity through nested `WeakMap`s, the same discipline
 * `emit-narrowing.ts`'s `spellability` memo uses, rather than a string key
 * built from `representationKey` -- so a compile's representations and its
 * plans are never retained past the compile that created them, and two
 * unrelated compiles sharing a coincidentally-equal key string can never
 * collide. `layouts` is the outermost key rather than an assumed-identical
 * singleton: the cache stays correct even if a caller ever passes a
 * different policy for the same pair, at the cost of one more miss, not a
 * wrong answer.

 * (`class-properties/emit-class-properties.ts`) has to ADD a receiver to the
 * carrier of a plain `obj.method` read. An interface that declares the same
 * method declares STORAGE for it -- a `gea::CallableObject` member with no
 * receiver in its frame -- so the two spellings of one method differ by
 * exactly the receiver, and nothing in `gea::CallableObject`'s four converting
 * constructors binds one.
 *
 * hono is where this stops the compile: `HonoBase.router` is declared
 * `Router<[H, RouterRoute]>` -- an interface whose members are `name`, `add`
 * and `match` -- and the constructor stores `new PatternRouter()` into it. The
 * class provides `name` as a field and the other two as methods, so the view
 * had two required members with no source field and refused, and the store
 * fell through to a raw assignment clang rejected.
 *
 * The binding is `gea::CallableObject`'s own public `(Invoke, void*)`
 * constructor over the receiver packed as the environment, which is the exact
 * shape every closure this backend emits already uses -- `packEnvironment`
 * keeps a heap copy (and therefore a reference count) for a carrier that can
 * outlive the frame, and the lambda unpacks it the same way a generated thunk
 * does. What it does NOT do is preserve identity: the view is a new object, so
 * a later write through the class reference is not seen through the view. That
 * is a real deviation, and it is the reason this is reached only after
 * `convertedValueText` has refused -- a pair with an identity-preserving
 * conversion never gets here.
 *
 * Refused, rather than rendered wrong, for a method that captures anything:
 * the environment slot is spent on the receiver, and a method with its own
 * captures needs both.

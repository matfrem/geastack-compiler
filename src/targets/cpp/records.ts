 * arrays and string/number dictionaries of such carriers, and other leaf
 * records -- AND the type graph under it has no cycle. An index signature's
 * value carrier counts as a field. Anything not named here
 * is not a leaf: a class (a `Ref` to a base may hold a subclass with more
 * fields, and a class owns method state), a callable, a boxed/dynamic carrier,
 * a promise, a Map/Set (subclassable), a host handle or host record, a borrowed
 * carrier (not an owned edge, so left to the existing answer), an array with an
 * extension sidecar, a recursive-carrier wrapper, an index sidecar of non-leaf values, an accessor
 * (it may carry a captured environment) and a reactive cell (it holds
 * subscribers). A back edge to a struct still being walked is a cycle, so every
 * struct on it fails -- that is what keeps a self-referential record traced.
 *
 * The verdict is only the emitter's claim: `gea_runtime.h`'s `RefTargetIsLeaf`
 * additionally requires the struct's own physical `TraceEdges` to be empty.
 * A native expando is a side-table entry, never a member of the struct and

 * `driverInfo: DriverInfo` (`default: {}`) in the MongoClient constructor.
 *
 * The three canonical primitive tags keep their exact `unboxField` arm, and a

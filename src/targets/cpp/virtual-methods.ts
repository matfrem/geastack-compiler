/**
 * Dispatch for a method the program overrides.
 *
 * `class-layout.ts` resolves a member by walking UP from the receiver's class,
 * which is the language's lookup only when the receiver's class is known
 * exactly. It is not what a CALL does: a receiver annotated as a base holds
 * whatever was constructed, and the language runs that object's implementation.
 * Binding the body the upward walk found is therefore right only while nothing
 * below redeclares the key -- and when something does, the emitted program runs
 * the base's body for every instance of a subclass, compiles, links, and is
 * silently wrong. gea3d-cube is the worked case: `Object3D.collectSelf` is
 * empty and `Mesh`/`Light` override it, so the renderer's scene walk collected
 * zero meshes and painted a cleared frame with no diagnostic anywhere.
 *
 * The mechanism here is C++'s own. The emitted structs already model the
 * language's inheritance as C++ inheritance (`records.ts`), single and with the
 * base subobject at offset zero -- which `gea::Ref`'s converting constructor
 * asserts -- so a virtual member on the root struct dispatches exactly as the
 * language specifies, at the cost of one vtable pointer per object. Nothing
 * else in the emission has to change shape: the member forwards to the same
 * free-function body the direct bind used to name.

 *
 * Two situations, one machine. A value the program itself declared `any` or
 * `unknown` and never narrowed is carried as `gea::Value`, and its properties
 * live in the `gea::DynamicObject` that box owns -- that is a real dynamic
 * boundary, one of the four `representation/model.ts` admits, and the honest
 * answer for it is a real property table rather than a refusal. A value that
 * DOES have a static type but is used dynamically (`(store as any)[key] = v`
 * on a class instance) is the opposite case: its storage stays exactly the
 * native struct it was, and the dynamic key goes into a `gea::DynamicObject`
 * SIDECAR beside the declared fields. Boxing the receiver to make the write
 * compile is the forbidden shortcut, and the sidecar is what makes refusing it
 * cost nothing.
 *
 * The two share this file because they share every hard part: turning a key
 * operand into a `gea::PropertyKey`, deciding what a read of an absent
 * property produces, and reconciling a statically-typed value into a boxed
 * slot on the way in. Splitting them would be two copies of one rule.

 * A constant key naming an optional generated field has more information: the
 * emitter can clear its typed value and independent presence bit, which is the
 * ordinary configurable-property delete. A plain record's REQUIRED field never
 * reaches here: `ir/certify/property-access.ts` leaves its `record:delete`
 * row unclaimed (`deleteNamesRecordExpandoKey`), because no direct read of a
 * required field consults its presence bit, and claiming the field disappeared
 * would make direct reads and reflective key queries disagree. A class

 * 10.1.10.1 `OrdinaryDelete`'s OWN outcome, not a real removal:

 *   there was never anything to delete, so nothing needs to happen.
 * - A `'property'` row is a data constant: every one of these (21.3.1's Math
 *   values; a builtin function's own restricted `name`/`length`, 10.2.4) is
 *   specified non-configurable, so `OrdinaryDelete` returns `false` without
 *   removing anything, and that is exactly what deleting one of these
 *   observably does -- nothing, forever.
 * - A `'method'` row (`Math.pow`, ...) IS specified configurable, so a

 *   per-instance storage a `native-handle` could lose a member from (every
 *   handle of one protocol is the same zero-size tag), so refusing by name is
 *   the honest answer rather than reporting a `true` that changes nothing.
 *

 * does for a get: there is no runtime member table to search a non-constant

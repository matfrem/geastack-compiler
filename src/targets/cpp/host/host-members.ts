 * What a host protocol's members lower to.
 *
 * A host object is not a struct this compiler lays out: its members are the
 * host's own implementation, reached by a spelling the host defines. So a
 * member is rendered from a template naming that spelling, exactly as the v1
 * plugin's host shims do (`geatsc-plugin-gea/src/host-shims.ts`), rather than
 * by inventing a field offset or a calling convention.
 *
 * Two kinds, because a host member is one of two things and the difference is
 * observable. A `property` is read at the access itself -- `el.scrollTop` is a
 * value. A `method` is NOT: `el.setAttribute` on its own is a function, and
 * what the program does is *call* it, so the template renders at the call and
 * the access alone renders nothing. Treating a method as a property would
 * materialise a callable no host symbol corresponds to.
 *
 * `{receiver}` is the object the member was reached through, `{arg0}`,
 * `{arg1}`, ... are the call's own arguments, and `{value}` -- in a `store`
 * template only -- is what is being written. A template naming a slot the site
 * does not supply is refused rather than rendered with a hole, so an arity the
 * host does not implement cannot reach C++.

  // id lookup into a store.
  //
  // `value` is declared `any`, which derives `dynamic` and carries

  // default-constructed `gea::Value`, which IS `undefined`: the right answer

  // distinguishes "states false" from "states nothing"), so the ternary below
  // is not a widening bolted on -- it is the same fact spelled in the carrier
  // the checker asked for. Emitting the bare `bool` instead type-checked in
  // this table and disagreed with the plan at the use site, which is the
  // checker-vs-physical-carrier defect this compiler exists to not have.
  // `{receiver}` repeats, which is safe: an operand's text is a value name or
  // a literal, never an expression with an effect to run twice.
  //
  // Every row is READ-ONLY. A write would have to reconcile an
  // `Optional<bool>` back onto a `bool` plus its flag, and nothing in the
  // corpus mutates a descriptor in place -- a program builds a literal and
  // passes it to `defineProperty`. So a write refuses by name rather than
  // carrying a reconciliation with no call site to check it.
  //
  // `get`/`set` have NO ROW AT ALL, so a read of either refuses by name.
  // `gea::PropertyDescriptor` stores an accessor as a native `std::function`
  // -- which is what lets `gea::runtime::object::get` actually invoke one --
  // and the program's own carrier for `(() => any) | undefined` is a
  // `gea::CallableObject`. Those are different physical types, and a row
  // spelling the member anyway would emit the descriptor's field where the
  // plan wants the callable. Converting between them is real work with a real
  // question in it (how the receiver reaches the getter), and it is not done

/**
 * A host function READ as a value: the function object the language says it is.
 *
 * `decodeURI` is an ordinary function object in ECMAScript (18.2.6.2 -- a
 * built-in whose value is a callable), so `const d = decodeURI` binds a
 * callable and nothing about it is special. What this backend has is a call
 * SPELLING, not a symbol of the right type, and a C++ function name is not a
 * `CallableObject`. The gap is a rendering, not a language fact.
 *
 * The rendering is the ABI the operand already carries, wrapped in the one
 * shape `CallableObject` accepts: a CAPTURELESS lambda matching its `Invoke`
 * (`Result (*)(void*, Arguments...)`), which converts to a plain function
 * pointer. No top-level helper has to be emitted, and no environment is
 * allocated, because there is nothing to capture -- the spelling is a fixed
 * path known at compile time.
 *
 * `null` for the two cases that genuinely have nothing to wrap, and both are
 * refused by the caller rather than approximated here:
 *
 *  - a spelling that is a TEMPLATE rather than a path, which is a recipe for
 *    filling in a call's own arguments and has no meaning without them;
 *  - a receiver-taking convention, whose thunk would have to capture the
 *    receiver and so could not be captureless.

 * A host METHOD read as a value: `console.error` in `(options?.onError ??

 * `console.error` produces the same function object calling it goes through,
 * and a program is free to store it, pass it, or pick it with `??`. What this
 * backend has instead is a call TEMPLATE keyed by protocol and member, which
 * is a recipe for a call site's arguments and names no C++ symbol on its own.
 *
 * So the read renders the template against a thunk's own formals -- the same
 * closing `hostFunctionValueText` already performs for a free host function,
 * and deliberately the same wrapper, because a host method read as a value is
 * not a different kind of value than a host function read as one.
 *
 * Three template shapes fill from bare formals and one does not:
 *
 *  - a fixed `{argN}` count, which fills positionally and refuses when the
 *    slot's convention has fewer parameters than the spelling names;
 *  - `'pass-through'`, whose single `{args}` slot takes the formals in order
 *    and leaves the overload choice to C++, exactly as a direct call does;
 *  - `'variadic'`, whose `{args}` slot is the ToString JOIN of the arguments
 *    (`console.log(a, b)` prints one space-separated line), computed here from
 *    the formals with the same abstract operation `consoleArgumentsText` runs
 *    over a direct call's operands;
 *  - `'call-site'`, which by definition has no template: its C++ depends on
 *    the static types of a CALL this read does not have. That refuses, and
 *    the refusal is honest rather than a guess at which renderer applies.
 *
 * A `{receiver}` cannot be filled either: the member was reached off a
 * receiver expression whose value this read did not keep, and a thunk holding
 * one would not be captureless. Every protocol whose members take a receiver
 * therefore refuses here by name.

/**
 * Where a body's locals live: the dominator tree of the graph a body RENDERS,
 * laid out as nested C++ blocks.
 *
 * A body is a `goto` graph, and C++ forbids a jump into the scope of a
 * variable whose declaration initializes it. The flat answer declared every
 * local at the top of the function, which is always legal and always the
 * widest possible lifetime: every `Ref`, `Value`, union and string any path
 * could need was constructed on entry and destroyed on exit, on EVERY call,
 * whichever path ran. An async body kept all of them in its coroutine frame
 * (2136 bytes for one hot mongodb command body), and the epilogue that
 * destroyed them all was code every call fetched -- measured, the driver
 * benchmark spent two thirds of its cycles waiting on instruction delivery.
 *
 * Nesting by dominance is what makes the narrow answer legal. Blocks are
 * written in a preorder of the dominator tree, each block's dominated blocks
 * inside its braces, so every predecessor of a block `Y` lies inside the
 * scope of `Y`'s immediate dominator -- which is where `Y`'s label is
 * written. A `goto` therefore only ever leaves scopes (destroying what they
 * hold, which nothing after can name) or lands beside the scope it left, after
 * that scope's declarations; it never enters one past its declarations. A back
 * edge to a loop header leaves the header's own scope and re-enters it from
 * the top, re-running each declaration -- a value defined in the header is a
 * fresh value on every turn, so that is what it means.
 *
 * Each declaration then goes to the deepest block whose subtree holds every
 * block that names it: the lowest common ancestor of its mentions. SSA makes
 * that the definition's block or above for a value, and for a merge or a cell
 * the common dominator of every write and read.

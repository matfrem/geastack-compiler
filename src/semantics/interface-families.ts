/**
 * The interfaces this program's `extends` edges connect, so that every view
 * of one object is ONE layout.
 *
 * JavaScript has no interfaces, and a program full of them still allocates
 * one kind of thing: tsc's `Node` is 300 interfaces -- `Statement`,
 * `Expression`, `Identifier`, `SourceFile`, ... -- every one of them a VIEW
 * of the same object `function Node(kind, pos, end)` allocated, written
 * through `as Mutable<Identifier>` casts and read back through `Statement`
 * parameters. Laying each interface out as its own struct gives one object
 * 300 incompatible C++ types, and the program's every `Identifier -> Node`
 * assignment becomes a conversion nothing can install: a copy would break
 * identity (`a === b`, a later write through the other view) and a
 * reinterpretation is not a conversion at all. On the tsc self-compile that
 * was the single largest family in the census after monomorphization landed:
 * 1,757 `native-record-ref -> native-record-ref` binding reads plus their
 * return, optional and union forms.
 *
 * So the layout follows the OBJECT, not the view: every interface a family
 * connects derives to one struct holding the union of the family's fields,
 * with a field required only where every member declares it required and
 * carried behind a presence bit otherwise -- exactly what an object of that
 * family may or may not own at runtime. The layout itself is built by
 * `structural.ts` (`familyBodyOf`), where the member types can be interned;
 * this census only answers WHICH declarations are one family.
 *
 * What is NOT a member, and why each exclusion is the rule rather than a
 * gap:
 *
 * - An interface in a declaration file. Its layout is a host protocol's, and
 *   the host owns it.
 * - An interface extending anything that is not itself a member candidate --
 *   `Array<T>` (`arrayHeritageShapeOf` lays that out as an array), a class,
 *   a type alias, an ambient interface. Its layout includes the base's
 *   members, which the family cannot own, and so do its descendants': the
 *   taint follows `extends` downward. The one exception is a lib
 *   key-remapping alias over a candidate (`Omit<I, 'k'>`, `Pick`, `Partial`,
 *   `Required`, `Readonly`): that base is `I`'s own members, so the edge is
 *   to `I`; so is an alias of a source object literal, or of an
 *   intersection of admissible bases (`heritageCandidatesOf` below).
 * - An interface with a call or construct signature (a callable, laid out as
 *   one), an index signature (a dictionary) or an accessor member (a body,
 *   not storage).
 * - A generic interface whose type parameter has no constraint that names a
 *   type: the family's field for `value: T` would have to be `unknown`, and
 *   a boxed slot in every object of the family is the defect this compiler
 *   exists to avoid. A constrained one (`Token<TKind extends SyntaxKind>`)
 *   is fine: its field is the constraint, which is what the union over every
 *   instantiation is anyway (`structural.ts`'s type-parameter fallback).
 *
 * A family of ONE is no family: its single member keeps the body its own
 * declaration states, exactly as before this census existed.

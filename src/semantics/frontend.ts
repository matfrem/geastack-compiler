  // argument was typed only from the checker's own evidence and this
  // parameter census's own internal fixpoint. A parameter whose call sites
  // pass an expression the RETURN or LOCAL census alone can type (`state`,
  // `extensions`, `m.elements`) stayed `any` forever, because by the time
  // those censuses learned it, the parameter census had already finished.
  //
  // A second round, given the first round's fully composed census as its
  // `upstream`, closes that gap: `parameter-bindings.ts`'s `known()` now
  // tries `upstream.typeAt(node)` wherever the checker's own answer is
  // unusable, ahead of its own machinery reconstructing one. See the commit
  // this landed in for the measured effect on the three.js app and the
  // check for whether a third round moves anything further.
  //
  // `withFieldBindings` sits LAST in each round, where its own header says it
  // belongs. A class field is the fourth storage position with no annotation
  // and a knowable answer, and it was the one still unread: three.js writes
  // `this.image`, `this.format`, `this.colorSpace` in a constructor and never
  // types them, so every `texture.format` read is `any` and every parameter
  // that receives one inherits it. That is what the boxed carriers in
  // `WebGLTextures.js` (4435) and `WebGLRenderer.js` (3982) are made of -- not
  // thousands of independent decisions, but one unread position cascading
  // through reads and member accesses (14349 `Identifier`, 6836
  // `PropertyAccessExpression` across the three.js app).
  // `withJsDocTypeNames` sits OUTERMOST, so a type the program STATED outranks
  // one inferred from an observed sample of call sites -- the same precedence a
  // TS annotation already has, which stops the call-site census outright. It is
  // last in the chain and first to answer.
  //
  // The RETURN census built inside the final round is kept, not rebuilt.
  // `producers/invocations.ts` reads a call's result through this composed
  // view and has to state the same call's CALLEE return from the same
  // authority; asking a second census would let the two settle differently.

   * `structural-array-element.ts`'s header documents the identical wall for
   * `never[]`.

   * this layer needs, without synthesizing anything: a rest capture over an

   * trades on. So this asks every REST write of the symbol for its pattern's

   * shape outright when it is an `array` -- never a `tuple`, which states a
   * fixed arity the rest slice does not share, and never anything else,
   * which states a value no array carrier could hold.
   *
   * Several rest writes to the same cell must AGREE (the identical shape) or
   * this refuses outright -- a real disagreement is not this layer's to
   * resolve, and a wrong pick would be worse than the box the cell keeps
   * today. A write whose source cannot be resolved to an array shape states
   * nothing either way and is skipped rather than treated as a conflict.
   *
   * The premise this whole function trades on is "`r` is written ONLY
   * through rest capture" (the header's own words: "written LATER through
   * `[a, ...r] = arr]`"). It used to take that on faith -- the write loop
   * below `continue`d past any write that was not itself a recognised rest
   * capture, silently discarding it rather than checking whether the
   * premise actually held. A plain `r = JSON.parse(...)` reassignment after
   * `[a, ...r] = [1, 2, 3]` reached exactly that `continue`, so this
   * function answered "array of number" from the ONE write it understood
   * while a genuinely dynamic value flowed into the SAME cell from the one
   * it ignored -- the store then read that dynamic value back through
   * `unboxDynamicArray<double>`, which aborted at runtime the moment the
   * parsed JSON held strings. Certified clean, compiled clean, `gea:
   * SIGABRT`. Fixed by refusing outright the moment ANY write this
   * authority cannot itself vouch for as a rest capture exists, rather than
   * silently answering from the subset it does understand -- the same
   * "a write that states nothing is not a write that disagrees, but a write
   * this authority never SAW is not evidence of agreement either" correction
   * `local-bindings.ts`'s `branchArmsOf` made for `||`/`??`/`?:` writes.

   *
   * The library's own signature is `getOwnPropertyDescriptor(o: any, p:
   * PropertyKey): PropertyDescriptor | undefined` -- fixed and non-generic, so
   * every call resolves to the identical ambient shape no matter what `o` is.
   * That is the right answer for a receiver this compiler never gave a shape of
   * its own (`Math`, `Array.prototype`, a value the program declared `any`):
   * there is no narrower fact to publish, and `value: any` is honest. It is the
   * wrong answer for a record literal, an array, or an in-program function,
   * whose OWN declared members already answer "what is `receiver[key]`" -- and
   * publishing the ambient `any` there is exactly the "typed value lowered into
   * `gea_cpp_value`" defect this compiler exists to refuse:
   * `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor({ a: 1 }, "a").value` would box a `number`
   * the record's own layout already states, for no reason but the library
   * text's own `any`.
   *
   * Lives here, in `typeAt`'s own module, rather than beside
   * `producers/invocations.ts`'s other result overrides: this is asked of the
   * bare CallExpression node ITSELF (not just consulted from inside the
   * invocation producer's own result computation), because `context.types.typeAt`
   * is the ONE authority every OTHER consumer of this same node's type reads
   * from -- a property access's own receiver type
   * (`producers/properties.ts`), a local binding's declared type
   * (`local-bindings.ts`) -- and an override that only changed what the
   * invocation producer PUBLISHES for its own operation result left every one
   * of those asking `context.types.typeAt` on the very same node with the
   * old, ambient, boxed answer: the call's own SSA value came out fully
   * native while the record it got stored into, and the receiver of a plain
   * `d.value` off it, still boxed. `evolvingArrayMemberTypeAt` above is
   * exposed the same way for the identical reason.
   *
   * Gated to receivers this compiler already treats as having a REAL,
   * in-program shape: `membersDropped === false` for an object literal
   * (`membersDropped` is `true` for an ambient interface enumerated
   * `data-only`, `host/object-protocol.ts`'s own distinction between the two),
   * and a physical, non-ambient value declaration for a function. A host
   * intrinsic still falls through to the ambient signature below untouched --
   * its own static reflection, if any, is a separate, host-table-driven
   * mechanism this function has no business pre-empting.
   *
   * A literal key that names a member answers with that member's own type. A
   * runtime key, or a literal that names no member, answers with the union of
   * every member this receiver states (an array: its element and `length`; a
   * function: `name` and `length`), plus the record's dynamic-property
   * SIDECAR's own boxed arm for a key `Object.defineProperty` could have
   * added after the fact -- the one accepted, bounded exception this feature

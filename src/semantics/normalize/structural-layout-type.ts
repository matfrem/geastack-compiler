   * fallback carries no such risk: it answers what a WRITE'S OWN VALUE
   * resolved to, not a re-derivation of the member's declared type, so it
   * is asked unconditionally.

   * A LITERAL TOKEN'S TYPE IS THE VALUE IT SPELLS. IT IS NOT A QUESTION ABOUT

   *
   * `getTypeAtLocation` answers a *positional* question: it types a node as an
   * expression only when the node's parent is one of the parent kinds it
   * enumerates as putting a literal in expression position. That enumeration is
   * incomplete for the three literal kinds that are lexical TOKENS rather than
   * expression nodes -- `StringLiteral`, `NumericLiteral` and
   * `NoSubstitutionTemplateLiteral` -- and when the parent is not on the list
   * the checker declines and hands back the error type, which reads as `any`.
   *
   * `export default <literal>` is one such position, and it is not a rare one:
   * measured on the three.js app, 110 modules are exactly `export default \`...\``, a
   * plain string with no substitutions in it, and every one of them boxed. The
   * same decline is reproducible in five lines of ordinary TypeScript --
   * `export default "hello"` and `export default 42` both answer `any`, while
   * `export default true` (a keyword, not a literal token) and `export default
   * \`a${1}b\`` (a `TemplateExpression`, an expression node) both answer
   * correctly. Nothing about it is specific to any library or any host.
   *
   * So this is not a second guess at a value the program left open, the way the
   * parameter census below is: a literal token can never *genuinely* be `any`,
   * because the token states its own value. Asked before every other question
   * for that reason. The `any` guard at the call site keeps it to the case
   * where the checker declined -- wherever the checker does answer, its answer
   * (including a widened or contextually-narrowed one) still wins.
   *
   * Positions where a literal token is deliberately not a value at all -- a
   * module specifier, a literal type node, a declared property name -- are
   * excluded rather than answered, so this only ever fills in a value the
   * program really does evaluate.

   *
   * `const fieldSource: Iterable<string> = { [Symbol.iterator](): FieldCursor
   * { ... } }`. ECMA-262 27.1 defines Iterable and Iterator as *protocols* --
   * the set of methods a value must answer to -- with no internal slot and no
   * allocation of their own, so `Iterable<string>` is a statement about how
   * this value may be USED, never about how it is stored. Adopting it as the
   * layout replaces the literal's own `[Symbol.iterator](): FieldCursor` with
   * the protocol's widened `(): Iterator<string>`, and the store of one
   * callable convention into the other has no conversion -- worse, a sliced
   * copy would rebind `next`'s receiver to the sliced record and lose the
   * `this.label` the cursor's whole body reads.
   *
   * Stated as the general property rather than by naming the iteration types,
   * because it IS the general reason a contextual type is worth adopting: a
   * declared shape earns the layout when it ADDS storage (`RequestInit`'s
   * optional members, which the literal omits and the record must still carry
   * a presence bit for) or when it supplies an identity the literal has none
   * of. One that declares only members the literal itself declares, more
   * loosely than the literal declares them, supplies neither -- it can only
   * cost precision. Lib-declared only: a PROGRAM interface is a nominal
   * identity this compiler keeps deliberately (`interface-families.ts`), and
   * the member-result census already keeps its members in agreement.

  /**
   * Whether adopting a CONTEXTUAL candidate would strand one of the literal's
   * own accessor bodies with nowhere to be installed.
   *
   * An index signature is a statement about what a READ of an unnamed key
   * yields, not about how a NAMED member the literal itself declares is
   * physically stored. `@hono/node-server`'s `request.ts` types its whole
   * prototype object `Record<string | symbol, any>` -- an escape hatch for
   * attaching private state under keys the declared type cannot enumerate --
   * and then declares `get method() { return this[methodKey] }` as a real
   * accessor. `Record<K, V>` instantiated over a non-literal key (`string |
   * symbol`) has no named property at all -- `getProperties()` is empty, only
   * `getIndexInfosOfType()` answers -- so adopting it as this literal's layout
   * carries the getter's own declaration nowhere: `structural.ts`'s member
   * walk (`objectShapeOf`) enumerates the CANDIDATE's own properties, not the
   * literal's, and a key the candidate never names as a property is never
   * visited, so the accessor body is dropped before `structural-parts.ts`'s
   * `literalAccessorOf` ever gets a symbol to ask about.
   * `producers/allocations.ts` then correctly refuses ("...has nowhere to
   * install its body") -- that guard is fail-closed and right to fire; the
   * defect is here, at the choice of layout, not at that guard.
   *
   * Narrow by construction: only fires for a key the literal declares as an
   * ACCESSOR. Ordinary data needs no named slot to be installed into a
   * dictionary -- `CreateDataPropertyOrThrow` writes through the index the
   * same way regardless, which is exactly why `isVacuousObjectType` above
   * deliberately treats an index-signature type as non-vacuous (voice-notes'
   * `Record<string, string>` header literal). And a candidate that DOES name
   * the key, even as plain data (`interface C { get next(): T }`, spelled as
   * data on purpose -- see `typed-custom-iterator-close.ts`), is untouched:
   * that case already has its own path, `structural-parts.ts`'s
   * `declaredMembers.accessorBodiesOf`, which needs the candidate's own
   * property SYMBOL to attach the literal's body to, and still gets one
   * there. Only a key with NO named property in the candidate at all -- an
   * index-only escape hatch, not a declared-but-untyped-as-accessor member --
   * reaches this refusal.

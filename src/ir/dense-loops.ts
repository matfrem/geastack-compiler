/**
 * Loops whose Array accesses can run against a raw element pointer, and the
 * one loop-invariant condition that makes that sound.
 *
 * `c[i * N + j] += a_ik * b_kj` compiles to a load and a store through
 * `ArrayObject`, and both of them can GROW the array -- a store past the end
 * appends, which is what `a[a.length] = x` means in JavaScript. clang has to
 * assume the storage may be reallocated on every iteration, so it reloads the
 * base pointer each time and cannot vectorize anything. Measured on
 * `bench/comparison`'s matrix_multiply: 35.5 ms, against 4.9 ms for the
 * hand-written C++ that indexes a `std::vector` it knows nobody resizes.
 *
 * Hoisting the base pointer alone does not fix it, and neither does a
 * per-access bounds check -- both measured 35 ms, because the branch that
 * could still reallocate is inside the loop either way. What does fix it is a
 * condition computed ONCE, before the loop:
 *
 *     geaFast = arr->holes.empty() && lower >= 0 && upper <= arr->size()
 *
 * and an access written `geaFast ? base[i].value : <the general form>`. The
 * flag is loop-invariant, so clang's own loop unswitching produces the two
 * loop bodies, and in the fast one nothing can resize: 7.9 ms, same answer.
 * That is why this is a flag rather than a duplicated block -- the versioning
 * already exists in the backend, and it only needed something invariant to
 * version on.
 *
 * The proof this computes is that the loop's own test bounds every index:
 *
 *   - the loop is ascending (`i < B` / `i <= B`) with the counter on the left,
 *     and the counter advances by a loop-invariant step, so inside the body
 *     `i` never exceeds `B`;
 *   - every index is the counter, or a loop-invariant base plus the counter,
 *     so the highest index the loop can reach is `base + B`;
 *   - and every use of the array inside the loop is one of those accesses --
 *     one `push`, one call taking the array, one write of the cell, and the
 *     window is no longer a window.
 *
 * The bound itself, the base and the counter's seed are all read at the
 * preheader and checked there. Nothing here assumes a length.

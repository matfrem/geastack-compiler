 * the plan, what lowering and the printer would do with it: seven builders
 * re-derived slots, receivers and key literalness so they could ask the
 * manifest the question the printer would later ask. This walks the IR that
 * lowering actually built. Every operation states its operands' carriers,
 * every `convert` cites the census node it applies, every allocation names
 * its captures -- so each capability the printer will need is a function of
 * the operation alone, spelled once here in the manifest's own vocabulary
 * and looked up in the manifest's own sets. The certificate is the empty
 * refusal list.
 *
 * One namespace. A key is `${family}:${discriminator}`; the family names the
 * manifest set the discriminator is a member of (`property-access` ->
 * `propertyRecipes`, `runtime-helper` -> `runtimeHelpers`, ...), or the
 * census that answers it (`conversion` -> the conversion census by node id).
 * A refusal anywhere in the compiler that names a key outside this union is
 * a type error, which is what closes the gap `scripts/refusal-keys.mjs`
 * measures.

 * question was certified by nobody and decided only at print time, so a
 * carrier the target could not transport certified clean and then emitted
 * nothing: precisely the certify/print disagreement 2.3's gate exists to
 * catch.
 *
 * The rules mirror `targets/cpp/captures.ts`'s admission exactly, because
 * they are the same rule asked at two stages rather than two rules:
 * a declaration with no placement is not a capture the environment carries; a
 * BOXED one is shared by aliasing, so copying its `std::shared_ptr` handle is
 * safe whatever its own carrier's ownership tier says, and only a carrier the
 * plan never selected (or left `unresolved`) is refusable there; everything
 * else, receiver included, must name an ownership the manifest publishes.

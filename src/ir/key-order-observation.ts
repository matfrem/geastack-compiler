/**
 * Which plain records have a key creation order nothing in the program can
 * read.
 *
 * A record's keys enumerate in the order they were created
 * (ECMA-262 10.1.11.1), which the runtime keeps per record: a note on every
 * store that creates a declared field out of layout order, a pend on every
 * literal written out of order, and an order-preserving walk on every spread
 * and `Object.assign`. A wide options record pays all of it on every
 * operation, and the order is read by nothing but enumeration.
 *
 * A shape is UNOBSERVED when
 *  - the reflection census holds it at `keys-only`: it never reaches a dynamic
 *    or unknown boundary, so no dynamic walk (`Object.keys` on a boxed value,
 *    `JSON.stringify`, a console, a bson serializer) can list its keys;
 *  - no operation lists its keys: `own-property-keys`, a `for`-`in`, the
 *    `Object.keys`/`values`/`entries` intrinsics, or any host template other
 *    than `Object.assign`;
 *  - nothing that receives its keys in order is observed: a spread or
 *    `Object.assign` copies the source's order into its receiver, so a source
 *    is observed wherever its receiver is (a fixpoint);
 *  - it never leaves for a non-record carrier by a conversion. A conversion to
 *    ANOTHER record shape is a view, which is built field by field in the
 *    target's layout order and keeps no part of the source's order.
 *
 * Everything not proven is observed, so a shape this cannot see through keeps
 * today's behaviour. An incomplete reflection census proves nothing, and a
 * record with an index sidecar is never proven (its sidecar keys interleave
 * with the declared ones).

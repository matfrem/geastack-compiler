/**
 * gea, as a plugin.
 *
 * Everything this library adds to TypeScript lives behind this one object: what
 * an element whose tag names a value means, which member of a constructed
 * component produces its tree, and the runtime rows that make those claims
 * checkable. Nothing in `src/` outside this directory knows any of it.
 *
 * The facts map is the whole of the state, and it is per-compilation by
 * construction: `instantiate` creates it, the producer fills it while
 * normalizing one program, and the lowering reads it while lowering that same
 * program. A registry of long-lived instances would let a fact derived from one
 * program be read back while compiling another -- a defect that reproduces only
 * in whatever order the programs happened to be compiled in.
 *
 * `componentClasses` is the same shape of state for a different question:
 * which class *declarations*, not which JSX elements, are gea's own. Both are
 * filled while normalizing and read only while lowering, for the identical
 * reason -- see `component-classes.ts` and `render-bridge.ts`.

/**
 * The suite the corpus cannot be.
 *
 * `corpus.mjs`'s `compiles` column is `clang -fsyntax-only`. It says the
 * emitted C++ parses -- never that it links, never that it runs, and never
 * that the answer is right. A whole class of defect lives in that gap and
 * produces no signal at all in the corpus: `Object.keys` returning the correct
 * keys in the wrong ORDER compiles perfectly, moves no column, and is wrong.
 * So does a store that reads a box back as the wrong type. Both shipped.
 *
 * Each program under `test/runtime/` declares what it must print, in `//!`
 * lines at the top:
 *
 *   //! expect: <substring that must appear in stdout>   (repeatable)
 *   //! expect-abort         (must die by signal; any `expect:` lines are STILL checked
 *                            against what it printed before dying)
 *   //! expect-refusal: <substring>                       (must be REFUSED at compile time, repeatable)
 *   //! known-wrong: <text>                              (a defect not yet fixed)
 *   //! emitted-has: <substring the emitted C++ must contain>     (repeatable)
 *   //! emitted-lacks: <substring the emitted C++ must not contain> (repeatable)
 *   //! emitted-once: <substring the emitted C++ must contain exactly once>
 *   //! compile-only                                     (check the C++, do not link it)
 *   //! dynamic-fallback                                 (compile with --dynamic-fallback)
 *   //! short-names                                      (compile with --short-names: structured loops and the text passes)
 *
 * `compile-only` is for a program this runner cannot link -- a JSX program
 * needs the engine's node type and a real document. Its shape is still pinned
 * and its C++ is still checked (`clang -fsyntax-only`); only the run is
 * dropped, and `expect` lines are meaningless on one.
 *
 * The last two are about the SHAPE of what the compiler wrote, which no
 * `expect` can see: a program prints the right answer whether or not the
 * emitter materialized a callable it never calls, copied a field it never
 * reads, or rebuilt a table of constants on every call. They exist so a
 * performance fix in the emitter is pinned by the same runner that pins its
 * correctness, and they are checked against the emitted units before the link.
 *
 * `known-wrong` is the honest half. A defect that is real, understood, and not
 * yet fixed is recorded here rather than deleted from the program or quietly
 * asserted as correct -- and the runner FAILS if a `known-wrong` line stops
 * being true, because a defect that silently fixes itself is a fact worth
 * learning, not a line to leave rotting.
 *
 * `expect-refusal` is the opposite of `known-wrong`: a program this compiler
 * must NOT certify. `run-emitted.mjs` prints `EMIT FAILED` plus the compile
 * log and exits 3 the moment `cli.js`'s own `--emit` refuses -- so this
 * directive asserts exactly that shape (a non-zero exit, and the named
 * refusal text present in the log) rather than the ordinary compile-link-run
 * a bare `expect` pins. A program that starts compiling clean where this
 * directive is present is the regression: a construct this compiler once
 * refused by name now certifies, which is worth catching by name, the same
 * way `known-wrong` catches a silent fix in the other direction.
 *
 *   node scripts/run-runtime-tests.mjs [--dist <dir>] [--only <substring>] [--shard <i>/<n>] [--translation-units single|per-file]
 *
 * `--shard <i>/<n>` runs every n-th program (1-based offset), which is the
 * only parallelism this suite has: each program is an independent
 * compile-link-run, so n shards at once cost what one does. Merge the
 * `ok`/`FAIL` lines afterwards; a shard may not write the status record.
 *
 * `--translation-units` is passed through to `run-emitted.mjs`, so the same
 * programs and the same expectations gate the per-file layout: a layout that
 * links and prints the same answers is one that split the program without
 * changing it.
 *
 * `--timings`, `--no-native-cache`, and `--no-pch` pass through to the native
 * builder. Each shard requires its own existing --out-dir; serial runs reuse
 * the default build directory and runtime PCH across programs and suite runs.
